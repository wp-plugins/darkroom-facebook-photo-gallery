The first Facebook Photo Album -to- jQuery-animated gallery for WordPress. Customizable in design and functionality.

== Description ==

[Live Demo](http://socialblogsitewebdesign.com/portfolio)
Why uploading your photos to both facebook and Wordpress? With this plugin you can keep them where your friends are already liking them, and displaying them in your website with the best interface neither facebook or WordPress offer.
Facebook Darkroom Photo Gallery is a fully animated jQuery photo gallery, inially styled as a darkroom photo drying line, with clothe pins and gravity-hung photos.
Each photo features title, SEO keywords and description, as well as album titles and cool effects!
Upload them from your mobile to Facbook as usual, and they will show in your WordPress (automated update using cron script).

See features below for a description of the level of customization that enables you to change this "Darkroom" concept/style into your own.
This plugin is based on the Fotobook plugin by Aaron Harp and Chris Wright, and was possible thanks to the jQuery tutorial by Manoela Ilic.

== Installation ==

This installation is for any other than the easy "install" button at your Dashboard/Plugins/Add New/Search page, of course.

1. Download and unzip
2. Upload the entire darkroom-facebook-photo-gallery folder to /your-wordpress-install-dir/wp-content/plugins/
3. Login to your WP Admin panel, click Plugins, and activate Fotobook
4. Go to Options and then click the Fotobook link. Follow the two steps for linking the plugin to a Facebook account.
5. Now import your albums on the Manage / Fotobook page.
6. Upload your logo (or choose not to use it) and other options in the "Darkroom" Dashboard's settings page

It works better in fluid layouts. If you can, just copy your page's template and make it fluid to use it with the gallery's page only. The more width is available the less-crowded the photos will appear when the albums get expanded.

To take advantage of SEO keywords, make sure you separate your Facebook photo captions into three parts, with an empty line between them (two carriage returns) as follow:

* **1st. line:** Photo title: Used for enlarged photo's caption and in thumbnail's alt attribute. Keep it as short as the photo's width.
* **2nd. line:** SEO tags: Used in the title attribute (the one revealed when the thumbnail is hovered).
* **Rest of text:** Photo description: Displayed at the top right when a photo is clicked.

== Screenshots ==

1. Here's the Darkroom style, but you could change it into a new concept by using different pins, clips, and styling.
2. This new style was the original idea achieved for a [famous Daylight Swordfishing Charter](http://www.floridakeysswordfishing.com) - soon online
